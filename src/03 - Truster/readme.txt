Challenge #3 - Truster
More and more lending pools are offering flash loans. In this case, a new pool
has launched that is offering flash loans of DVT tokens for free.

The pool holds 1 million DVT tokens. You have nothing.

To pass this challenge, take all tokens out of the pool. If possible, in a
single transaction.
