Challenge #9 - Puppet V2

The developers of the previous pool (Challenge #8 Puppet) seem to have learned
the lesson. And released a new version!

Now theyâ€™re using a Uniswap v2 exchange** as a price oracle, along with the
recommended utility libraries. That should be enough.

You start with 20 ETH and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The pool has a million
DVT tokens in balance. You know what to do.
