Challenge #5 - The Rewarder

There’s a pool offering rewards in tokens every 5 days for those who deposit
their DVT tokens into it.

Alice, Bob, Charlie and David have already deposited some DVT tokens, and have
won their rewards!

You don’t have any DVT tokens. But in the upcoming round, you must claim most
rewards for yourself.

By the way, rumours say a new pool has just launched. Isn’t it offering flash
loans of DVT tokens?
