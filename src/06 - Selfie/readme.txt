Challenge #6 - Selfie

A new cool lending pool has launched! Itâ€™s now offering flash loans of DVT
tokens. It even includes a fancy governance mechanism to control it.

What could go wrong, right ?

You start with no DVT tokens in balance, and the pool has 1.5 million. Your
goal is to take them all.
