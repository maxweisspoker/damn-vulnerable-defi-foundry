Challenge #10 - Free Rider

A new marketplace of Damn Valuable NFTs has been released! There’s been an
initial mint of 6 NFTs, which are available for sale in the marketplace. Each
one at 15 ETH.

The developers behind it have been notified the marketplace is vulnerable. All
tokens can be taken. Yet they have absolutely no idea how to do it. So they’re
offering a bounty of 45 ETH for whoever is willing to take the NFTs out and
send them their way.

You’ve agreed to help. Although, you only have 0.1 ETH in balance. The devs
just won’t reply to your messages asking for more.

If only you could get free ETH, at least for an instant.
