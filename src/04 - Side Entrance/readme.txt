Challenge #4 - Side Entrance

A surprisingly simple pool allows anyone to deposit ETH, and withdraw it at any
point in time.

It has 1000 ETH in balance already, and is offering free flash loans using the
deposited ETH to promote their system.

Starting with 1 ETH in balance, pass the challenge by taking all ETH from the
pool.
